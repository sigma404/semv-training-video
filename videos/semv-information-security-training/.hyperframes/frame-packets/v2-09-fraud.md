## Frame 9 — Phần 4: Lừa đảo tài chính

- scene: Năm kênh liên lạc (email, tin nhắn, cuộc gọi, website giả, mạng xã hội) dồn vào một nhân vật "kẻ gian" đeo 3 mặt nạ (cơ quan chức năng, người thân, đối tác), rồi tới yêu cầu "Chuyển khoản" bị gạch đỏ
- voiceover: "Còn lừa đảo tài chính đến qua email, tin nhắn, cuộc gọi, website giả và mạng xã hội — kẻ gian mạo danh cơ quan chức năng, người thân hay đối tác để yêu cầu chuyển khoản."
- duration: 12.872s
- transition_in: push-slide LEFT
- status: outline
- src: compositions/frames/v2-09-fraud.html
- type: social_proof
- persuasion: Causal chain (kênh → mạo danh → chuyển khoản)
- beat: Alertness
- blueprint: constellation-hub (Adapt)
- focal: thẻ "Yêu cầu chuyển khoản" có nhãn đỏ "Lừa đảo"
- roles: 5 pill kênh có icon = supporting nodes (cột trái) · cụm 3 vai mạo danh (icon tòa nhà công quyền, gia đình, bắt tay) = midground (giữa) · thẻ "Yêu cầu chuyển khoản" + nhãn đỏ "Lừa đảo" = foreground subject (phải) · đường nối hairline trái→giữa→phải = supporting · slide-header = supporting · nền trắng = background

narrativeRole: Cho thấy đường đi của một vụ lừa đảo tài chính, từ kênh tiếp cận tới yêu cầu chuyển tiền.
keyMessage: Bất kỳ kênh nào cũng có thể là kẻ gian mạo danh; một yêu cầu chuyển khoản là dấu hiệu dừng lại.

Adapt: giữ signature của constellation-hub (các node bật vào rồi dồn về một lõi); ở đây các node xếp thành dòng chảy trái→phải, lõi là thẻ "Yêu cầu chuyển khoản".
Scene 1 (0.0–1.4s): slide-header: eyebrow "PHẦN 4/5 · SỰ CỐ THỰC TẾ", tag-pill "Lừa đảo tài chính", h2 "Lừa đảo tài chính, ngân hàng" hiện ở "lừa đảo tài chính" (0.3s).
Scene 2 (1.6–5.5s): năm pill kênh xếp dọc ở cột trái, mỗi pill đúng lúc tên kênh được đọc: "Email" 1.6s · "Tin nhắn" 2.3s · "Cuộc gọi" 3.0s · "Website giả" 3.8s · "Mạng xã hội" 4.8s.
Scene 3 (5.7–8.6s): đường nối hairline từ 5 pill dồn về cột giữa (svg-path-draw) ở "kẻ gian" (5.7s); ba thẻ mạo danh xếp dọc: "Cơ quan chức năng" 6.5s · "Người thân" 7.7s · "Đối tác" 8.3s; phía trên có nhãn "MẠO DANH" (eyebrow, đỏ).
Scene 4 (8.7–10.0s): đường nối từ cột giữa sang thẻ phải "Yêu cầu chuyển khoản" (icon thẻ ngân hàng + mũi tên), thẻ vào ở "yêu cầu chuyển khoản" (9.0s); nhãn đỏ "Lừa đảo" đóng dấu ở 9.6s.
Scene 5 (10.0–12.872s): giữ đọc, đứng yên.

## Selected blueprint: constellation-hub

# constellation-hub — Constellation / Hub + Satellites

**intent**: Labeled/iconned nodes spring into a ring/cluster around a center, then the shot resolves on the core — either by pushing the camera INTO the center (depth-of-field collapsing onto it) or by holding a hub mark while the satellites ORBIT it; the "everything connects to / sits around one center" beat.

**roles served**

- Hook (from `hook-cluster-push-in`): a constellation of tool/app nodes springs into a wide ring, then a sustained camera push-in with depth-of-field resolves on the inner core — "it connects everything / one hub for all your tools."
- Social_Proof (from `social-proof-orbit-ecosystem`): the product brand mark lands as the center hub and partner logos spring onto a ring and revolve around it — "plugs into / sits at the center of your stack."
- CTA (from `cta-orbit-collapse`): the ring resolves by COLLAPSE rather than a push-in — category icons drift around an empty central CTA, a cursor click implodes the orbit toward the click point, and the product demo springs OUT of that collapse as the answer (scope → choice → consequence → product).
- Social_Proof (from `proof-logo-chain`): a persistent center logo accrues proofs — its wordmark decodes, a claim ticker swaps, the logo glides to center, then avatars cascade into orbit with drawn connectors while partner logos scroll the bottom strip; four claims read as one statement.
- Social_Proof (from `scatter-drift-finisher`): the ecosystem beat as a
  static END CARD — a two-line serif `[headline]` is the center (no hub mark, no ring), `[~20 app
icons]` pop in scattered frame-wide in a quick stagger, then keep drifting very slowly OUTWARD
  to the end. "Connects to thousands of apps" said with count and spread, not geometry.

**duration**: 5–8s (Hook 5–6s · Social_Proof 5–8s · CTA orbit-collapse ~6s · Social_Proof
scatter-drift end card ~2.5s as a closing beat)

**shot structure**

Consolidated template — nodes ring a center, then one of two finishers resolves on the core.

- Scene 1 (0.0–~1.5s): `[bg]` (dark/space field, optionally slow-drifting diffused gradient blobs). `[primary nodes]` (circles carrying `[icon]` + label) SPRING-POP in (scale 0→1, ~1.15 elastic overshoot, staggered) arranged in a wide ring/cluster around an empty or marked center `[hub]`.
- Scene 2 (~0.7–2.5s, overlapping): smaller `[secondary nodes]` (platform / partner-logo chips) pop in staggered with the same elastic spring, filling the gaps; optional thin `[accent]` connector lines / orbit ring draw from hub→nodes. Camera holds.
- Scene 3 (~2.5–Xs, the resolve): see finisher variant below; lands and HOLDS on the magnified / orbited center to the end.

- Variant — Hook (push-in finisher): from Scene 3, a continuous smooth CAMERA PUSH-IN toward the center inner cluster — inner nodes scale up and stay sharp while outer nodes are pushed toward the edges and progressively BLUR (depth-of-field), background scales up smoothly; holds magnified on the core.
- Variant — Social_Proof (orbit finisher): the center `[brand mark]` snaps in via a quick 3D rotate that decelerates and settles; a thin `[accent]` orbit ring draws around it; `[N partner badges]` spring onto the ring (staggered overshoot) and revolve CLOCKWISE while staying upright, under a continuous slow camera ZOOM-OUT (ecosystem reveal).
- Variant — Social_Proof (optional type-push-through opener, prepended before Scene 1): centered `[headline]` types/slides in with a huge transparent-fill OUTLINE copy of the same words behind it; the outline text scales up exponentially toward camera (high-speed dolly / push-through), breaches the frame, then HARD-CUTS to the hub bg of Scene 1.
- Variant — Social_Proof (scatter-drift finisher, no ring): the center is a two-line serif
  `[headline]` building in place (not a mark); `[~20 app icons]` pop in SCATTERED across the whole
  frame in a quick stagger — no ring geometry, no connectors — then sustain a very slow outward
  drift to the end. Camera fully static: no push-in, no zoom-out; the "everything around one
  center" reads from the drift vectors pointing away from the headline. Often chained as the end
  card of a preceding UI beat (the prior card dissolves into it).

**motion vocabulary**: staggered elastic spring-pop node entrances (~1.15 overshoot); slow gradient-blob drift; connector-line / orbit-ring draw-on; 3D snap-rotate-settle on the hub mark; continuous camera push-in (inner sharp, outer depth-of-field blur, bg scale-up); clockwise orbital revolve of upright badges; continuous slow camera zoom-out (ecosystem reveal); optional outline-text push-through dolly entry. Scatter-drift finisher: frame-wide scattered icon pop-in (staggered, no ring); sustained slow
outward icon drift; in-place two-line serif headline build; static-frame hold to the end.

**rule mapping** (motion verb → `rules/<id>.md`)

- staggered spring-pop node entrances → `spring-pop-entrance` (elastic overshoot) + `gsap-effects` (stagger recipe); 3D-flip-in flavor → `orbit-3d-entry`
- ring / cluster layout of nodes around a center → `avatar-cloud-network` (nodes on an elliptical ring + SVG lines to a center)
- icons on the nodes → `svg-icon-enrichment`
- connector lines hub→node → `svg-path-draw`
- orbit-ring draw-on → `svg-path-draw`
- slow gradient-blob drift → `sine-wave-loop` (idle looped drift)
- 3D snap-rotate-settle on hub mark → `orbit-3d-entry` (3D-flip entry); technique CSS-3D
- clockwise orbital revolve of upright badges → `orbit-3d-entry` (continuous elliptical orbit); technique MotionPath
- camera push-in toward center → `multi-phase-camera` (PUSH-in) + `coordinate-target-zoom` (target the core)
- background scale-up during push-in → `multi-phase-camera`
- continuous slow zoom-out (ecosystem reveal) → `multi-phase-camera` (pull-back) / `coordinate-target-zoom`
- outline-text push-through dolly opener (Social_Proof) → `3d-text-depth-layers` (outline copy behind) + `multi-phase-camera` (push-through)
- depth-of-field blur on outer nodes during push-in → `depth-of-field-blur` (progressive DOF/focus-falloff blur on the off-center outer nodes while the inner core stays sharp)
- frame-wide scattered icon pop-in (no ring) → `spring-pop-entrance` (staggered group) +
  `gsap-effects` (stagger recipe); positions pre-baked scattered — NOT `avatar-cloud-network`'s
  elliptical ring
- sustained slow outward icon drift → `center-outward-expansion` (outward vectors, slow sustained
  register — drift targets sit slightly past the pop-in positions)
- in-place serif headline build → `gsap-effects` (staggered line/word reveal)

**camera modifier**: push-in-with-DOF (Hook) — `multi-phase-camera` PUSH-in targeted via `coordinate-target-zoom` onto the core; the focus-falloff blur half of it is backed by `depth-of-field-blur`. Orbit finisher (Social_Proof) — slow continuous zoom-out via `multi-phase-camera` (pull-back) while satellites revolve. Scatter-drift finisher (Social_Proof end card) — none: the frame never moves; the outward drift
is element-level.

# SVG Path Draw

Reveals an SVG shape by animating its stroke as if a pen were tracing it. Two stroke properties together: **`stroke-dasharray = <pathLength>`** makes the entire path one dash; **`stroke-dashoffset`** starts at the path length (dash shifted fully out of view → invisible) and tweens to `0` (fully drawn). The length comes from the DOM API `path.getTotalLength()` — measured, never guessed.

Works on anything with a stroke: `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`, `<ellipse>`.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<svg class="logo-mark" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path id="bar-left" d="M 60 40 L 60 160" />
  <path id="bar-right" d="M 140 40 L 140 160" />
  <path id="bar-mid" d="M 60 100 L 140 100" />
</svg>
```

```css
.logo-mark path {
  fill: none; /* outline-only draw — a fill would appear immediately and ruin the reveal */
  stroke: {accentColor};
  stroke-width: 12;
  stroke-linecap: round; /* softer endpoints */
  stroke-linejoin: round;
}
```

```js
// Setup: measure each path and set its dash pattern. Real measured geometry, not a magic number.
document.querySelectorAll(".logo-mark path").forEach((p) => {
  const len = p.getTotalLength();
  p.style.strokeDasharray = `${len}`;
  p.style.strokeDashoffset = `${len}`;
});

// Stagger draws so the eye reads continuous motion — each segment starts at
// ~70-80% of the previous segment's duration, before it finishes.
tl.to(
  "#bar-left",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-right",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_2_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-mid",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_3_START,
);

// Companion wordmark fades in only after the last stroke settles.
tl.to(
  ".brand-line",
  { opacity: 1, duration: BRAND_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  BRAND_FADE_START,
);
```

## Variations

- **Ring starting at 12 o'clock** — `<circle>` / `<rect>` strokes start at 3 o'clock by default; rotate the element `-90deg` so a progress ring draws from the top:

```html
<circle
  cx="100"
  cy="100"
  r="60"
  id="ring"
  style="transform-origin: 100px 100px; transform: rotate(-90deg)"
/>
```

- **Linear (constant-speed) draw** — `ease: "none"` for a steady-rate "real pen" trace.
- **Draw then fill** — for filled shapes, tween `fillOpacity: 0 → 1` AFTER the stroke completes (requires `fill-opacity: 0` initially and a real `fill` in CSS):

```js
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { fillOpacity: 1, duration: FILL_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  SEG_1_START + SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR,
);
```

## Values

| token             | range                                   | notes                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR  | 0.3–0.8s                                | fast snap vs deliberate pen trace; >~1s feels sluggish for a logo reveal                           |
| FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR | 60–80% of SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR              | proportional to segment length — a short connector at full duration reads slower than its siblings |
| SEG_N_START       | previous start + 70–80% of its duration | reads as continuous motion, not N isolated animations                                              |
| SEG_1_START       | 0–0.4s                                  | a small ~0.2s lead-in lets the viewer settle before motion                                         |
| BRAND_FADE_START  | ≥ last stroke end (+ ~0.2s beat)        | earlier and the wordmark competes with the draw                                                    |
| BRAND_FADE_DUR    | 0.3–0.8s                                | snap (urgent) vs glide (premium)                                                                   |

Ease families are discrete choices: **stroke draws** use `power2.out` (a hand lifting at end of stroke) or `none` for constant speed — never `back.out` / `elastic.out` (pens don't bounce). **Fades** use `power1.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **`fill: none`** for outline-only draws — otherwise the fill appears immediately.
- **Dasharray/dashoffset = the measured `getTotalLength()`**, set at setup; requires the SVG in the DOM (inline SVG is fine; a loaded `<image>` SVG is not).
- **Complex paths**: if `getTotalLength()` looks wrong, overestimate slightly (`len * 1.05`) — too large is invisible at animation start; too small clips the end.
- **Stagger multi-path draws at ~70–80%** of the previous segment's duration.
- **A drawn line must land on something.** When the path is a connector (rail, beam, underline, callout) rather than a shape, both endpoints must sit on real elements and the draw must do a job — reveal, route, validate, or emphasize. A stroke that only decorates empty space reads as filler; attach it or cut it.
